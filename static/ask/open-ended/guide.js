The "ask me" button will ask you questions about your code.
Answering these questions will help you learn to understand code.

After a while you may find the questions or repetitive, or easy to answer.
That's the perfect! If you no longer need the button, you're doing great.

In the config panel you can decide what questions you'd like to explore:

Language Features:

  choose the language features you'd like to explore

Levels:

  1. The Code (syntax)
    questions about JS Syntax, vocabulary and pronunciation
    you don't need to understand the program to answer these questions
  2. How it Works (semantics)
    questions about the language features and how they are interpreted by JS
    you will need to understand how different features of JS work
    and you will need to practice seeing each little piece in a big picture
  3. Connections
    questions about how different lines of code are related
    you will need to find connections between across many lines
    these questions often ask you to think about the data stored in variables
  4. Goals
    questions about important goals in the program and how it achieves them
    you will need to think of the big picture to answer these questions
    you do not need to understand every line of code to answer these questions
    you will need to understand the data in your program, and how it is used
  5. User Experience
    questions about the user's experience of this program
    you will need to think about user interactions, and user journey paths
    and about the data a user provides, or that a user receives
