1. cek (no store)
  leave out:
    instrumented functions called by outside world (callbacks passed to natives/libraries)
    store. can be managed by JS, i just look at it
    tracking changes to objects by non-instrumented code
2. store
  - entering membrane territory
  ie. splice array - proxify array to trace changes
    more protection - weakmap from proxy to arrays

easy fix for native HOFs
  register all declarations in code
  do not render when not within one of these's calls


pieces
  user advice
  combiner
    cesking advice


1. user writes advice
2. passes advice to combiner
3. combiner returns combined advice & new history

it should
  know at each step if it was pointcuted or not
    need to also wrap the user's pointcut
