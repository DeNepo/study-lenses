/*
  boolean configs for which language features will be traced
  defaults to only:
    - variables (and implicitly scop  e, by indentation)
    - errors (for more student-friendly error logs)
    at least once it's ready for use, in dev we use this file to configure
  all other options can be set in study.json
  or configured by the student from the UI

  note: all data types are always traced, that is not configurable
        they will also be deep-cloned before being logged
