Convert any file of code into a Parsons Problem. But what's that?

A Parsons problem is a type of exercise where you are given lines of code on the left, and you need to click/drag them into the correct order on the right.  Check out <a href='./?parsons=%7B"code"%3A"const%20x%20%3D%20true%3B%5Cnif%20(x)%20%7B%5Cn%20%20console.log(%60x%20is%20%24%7Bx%7D!%60)%3B%5Cn%7D%5Cn%5Cn"%2C"ext"%3A".js"%2C"loopGuard"%3A%7B"active"%3Afalse%2C"max"%3A20%7D%7D' target="_blank">this example</a> to get a feel for it.

Careful!  indentation matters ;)
