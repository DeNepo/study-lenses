# `?leitner`

A lens for writing and studying Markdown flashcards using the
[Leitner System](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6S2LJIAydyg).

## Storing and Studying

This lens is set up to help you organize your flashcards by topic in a folder system, but to
study them with a Leitner schedule.

- In your computer's file system they will be stored however you organize your
  files and folders.
- When you run the `study` command in your terminal and the cards open in your
  browser, they will be organized by Leitner boxes so you can schedule your
  study sessions.

## Creating new Flashcards

To create a new flashcard you just create a new markdown file! You can also
create new folders and organize your flashcards in nested folders, when you
refresh your browser new flashcards will appear in box 1.

## Updating Flashcards

You can change the contents of a flashcard without any problems. If you rename a file or move it, then that card will be put back in box 1.
