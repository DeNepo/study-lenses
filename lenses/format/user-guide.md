This lens will format your code using [Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier), to see it in action try these parameters on a file of code (without the `--help` option):

- `?` - see your code as it is in the file, no changes
- `?format` - see the same code formatted
- `?format&highlight` -  formatted, and highlighted
- `?highlight` (for comparison)


Only these file types will be formatted, all other file types will be ignored:

- `.js`
- `.html`
- `.css`
- `.md`
